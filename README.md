# YouTube Video Metadata Push to GitHub README

This README explains the logic behind the provided Python script for fetching metadata of a YouTube video and pushing it to a GitHub repository.

## Overview

The provided Python script aims to automate the process of fetching metadata of a specific YouTube video and pushing that metadata to a GitHub repository. The script is divided into two main functions:

1. `fetch_youtube_video_id()`: This function fetches the metadata of a specific YouTube video based on a provided channel ID and video name. It then saves this metadata into a JSON file named `video_meta.json`.

2. `push_youtube_meta_to_github()`: This function reads the content of the `video_meta.json` file and pushes it to a specified GitHub repository. It first attempts to update the existing file in the repository. If the file does not exist, it creates a new one.

## Dependencies

The script relies on the following Python libraries:

- `os`: For accessing environment variables and file operations.
- `json`: For working with JSON data.
- `googleapiclient`: For interacting with the YouTube Data API.
- `github`: For interacting with GitHub repositories.

Make sure to install these dependencies using `pip install` before running the script.

## Usage

To use the script:

1. Set up the necessary environment variables:
    - `GH_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Your GitHub personal access token with 'repo' scope.
    - `YOU_TUBE_API_KEY`: Your YouTube Data API key.

2. Replace the following placeholders in the script with your own values:
    - `repo_owner`: The owner of the GitHub repository.
    - `repo_name`: The name of the GitHub repository.
    - `channel_id`: The ID of the YouTube channel you want to search for.
    - `video_name`: The name of the YouTube video you want to search for.

3. Run the `main()` function to execute the script.

## Logic Flow

Here's a brief explanation of how the script works:

1. The `fetch_youtube_video_id()` function uses the YouTube Data API to search for videos based on the provided channel ID and video name. It retrieves the metadata of the first search result and saves it into a JSON file named `video_meta.json`.

2. The `push_youtube_meta_to_github()` function reads the content of the `video_meta.json` file. It then attempts to update the existing file in the specified GitHub repository. If the file does not exist, it creates a new one with the fetched metadata.

3. The `main()` function orchestrates the execution of the two functions mentioned above.

## Error Handling

The script includes basic error handling for file operations and API requests. It prints informative messages to the console if any errors occur during execution.

## Conclusion

This Python script provides a convenient way to automate the process of fetching metadata of a YouTube video and pushing it to a GitHub repository. It can be integrated into various workflows for managing video metadata effectively.
